# Project Review â€“ Motion-Activated LED with Adjustable Light Sensitivity & Delay

This folder contains the full technical design review for the motion-activated LED circuit.  
The review covers the complete design process from concept to real-world use, including  
electrical design, mechanical considerations, build steps, testing methodology, and reasoning  
behind every design choice.

All materials are open source. Users can reproduce the project, adapt it to their needs,  
and modify the provided PCB and enclosure files.

## How to Navigate

Each section is self-contained and can be read independently, but following them in  
order will give the most complete understanding of the project. The **Design Overview**  
dives into the TLV8544 nanopower op-amp stages, the 3.3 V regulator integration, and  
how the PIR and light-sensitivity controls interface with the delay circuitry.
